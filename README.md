# MH-MCMC_Algorithm

In this project, Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) random walk algorithm is used to estimate different cosmological parameters i.e. Hubble constant h from supernova Ia data.

Second task is to use MCMC simulation to analyse data from photographic plates from Eddington's 1919 eclipse expedition in order to determine whether the data favour Newtonian gravity or Einstein's General Theory or Relativity.

Third task is to do Gelman-Rubin Convergence test to evaluates MCMC convergence by analyzing the difference between multiple Markov chains.
